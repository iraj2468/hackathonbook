# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Principle I: Accuracy
All claims are validated against primary sources, including official documentation (ROS2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, V-JEPA) and peer-reviewed robotics research. A minimum of 50% of sources must be from these categories. Full adherence to APA citation style is mandatory.

### Principle II: Clarity
Content is written for a university-level academic audience with a background in computer science and AI. Explanations must be clear, direct, and accessible, maintaining a Flesch-Kincaid grade level between 10 and 12. Every chapter must include diagrams, tables, and code blocks to support learning.

### Principle III: Reproducibility
Every code example, exercise, and simulation is self-contained and guaranteed to work using the Spec-Kit Plus workflow. All dependencies and environment setup instructions are explicitly documented to ensure a frictionless user experience.

### Principle IV: Rigor
All technical content, especially algorithms and simulations, undergoes a strict verification process by a designated Technical Reviewer. The project maintains zero tolerance for plagiarism, enforced through automated checks.

## Project Standards & Constraints

- **Source Verification**: All technical claims must be verifiable with official documentation or peer-reviewed sources.
- **Citation Format**: APA style is mandatory for all citations.
- **Source Mix**: A minimum of 50% of all cited sources must be peer-reviewed articles or official technical documentation.
- **Plagiarism**: Zero tolerance policy.
- **Readability**: Content must target a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 10-12.
- **Chapter Structure**: Every chapter must include diagrams, tables, code blocks, and exercises.
- **Course Alignment**: Chapters must strictly follow the 13-week course outline.
- **Format**: All content must be in Docusaurus-compatible Markdown (.md/.mdx).
- **Length**: The total book length is targeted for 200-250 pages, equating to approximately 13 chapters.
- **Workflow**: All AI and robotics examples must be reproducible and run within the Spec-Kit Plus workflow.
- **Deployment Target**: The final output must be deployment-ready for GitHub Pages.

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Book Architect**: Designs the complete book structure, chapter flow, and sidebar navigation.
- **Lead Author**: Writes the primary textbook chapters in Docusaurus Markdown.
- **Research Assistant**: Gathers and verifies accurate references, technical examples, and primary sources.
- **Instructional Designer**: Creates and integrates learning outcomes, exercises, chapter summaries, diagram descriptions, and quizzes.
- **Technical Reviewer**: Validates the correctness of all AI/robotics algorithms, code, simulations, and technical examples.
- **Docusaurus Publisher**: Formats all chapters for Docusaurus, maintains sidebar configurations, and prepares the project for deployment.
- **Deployment Manager**: Manages the build process and ensures successful deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Governance

This Constitution is the authoritative source for all project principles, standards, and procedures. All contributions and reviews must align with its rules.

- **Compliance**: All work must be checked for compliance with this constitution.
- **Success Criteria**: The project is considered successful when all chapters are generated and formatted correctly, technical content is verified, sidebar navigation is correct, the Docusaurus build runs without errors, and the book is fully ready for deployment.
- **Amendments**: Any changes to this constitution require a documented proposal, review, and an update to the version number following semantic versioning rules.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-12-12 | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-12
